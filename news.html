            <h3>6.27.2010</h3>
             <p>We are happy to welcome our newest graduate student, Marley Kass, who got an early start today before her September matriculation in our PhD program in Behavioral Neuroscience.  Marley come to us from Seton Hall, where she earned a Master's degree in Experimental Psychology.</p>
 
            <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>

            <h3>6.16.2010</h3>
             <p>We found a good use for the empty space where the Rm. 316 vestibule used to be before it was bricked up as part of the renovations.  Now it houses a microscope for fluorescence imaging from immunohistochemically-labeled tissue.  Yes, those are cement blocks from Home Depot.  <a href="http://rci.rutgers.edu/~jmcgann/fluorescence_scope.jpg">CLICK HERE</a>. </p>
 
            <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>

            <h3>2.16.2010</h3>
             <p>We finally have a functioning tank farm in the wet lab, where tanks containing compressed air, nitrogen, etc, are hooked into a network of pipes that distribute these gases throughout the rest of the laboratory.<a href="https://mcgannlab.github.io/wetlab.jpg">Check It Out</a>. </p>
 
            <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>

            <h3>1.16.2010</h3>
             <p>  We have our first imaging rig up and running.  This apparatus allows us to watch the patterns of neural input to the mouse olfactory bulb when a living, breathing mouse smells an odor.  To see it, <a href="https://mcgannlab.github.io/imaging_rig.jpg">CLICK HERE</a>. </p>
 
            <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>

            <h3>10.16.2009</h3>
             <p>We've finally moved into the renovated laboratory space!  They're still putting the finishing touches on it, but we can get our equipment up and running.  For some before and after pictures of the renovation, <a href="https://mcgannlab.github.io/renovations.html">CLICK HERE</a>. </p>
 
            <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>

            <h3>10.12.2009</h3>
             <p>Look for us at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting in Chicago on Sunday!  Sneha will be presenting her first scientific poster, on the representation of odorant concentration in the olfactory bulb.</p>
 
            <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>


            <h3>09.17.2009</h3>
             <p>The lab renovations are approaching completion at long last.  The new walls are done, the plumbing is almost complete, and the casework (the cabinets and benches) were delivered this morning.  Check out the tractor trailer that delivered the case work this morning <a href="https://mcgannlab.github.io/trailer.jpg">HERE</a>.</p>
 
            <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>

            <h3>08.28.2009</h3>
             <p>Welcome to Lindsey Czarnecki, our new PhD student in Rutgers Psychology!  Lindsey joins us from her master's degree program at Seton Hall, and we are very happy to have her aboard.  </p>
 
            <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>


            <h3>08.27.2009</h3>
             <p>We're hiring!  We're looking for a postdoctoral associate with experience in neurophysiology, behavioral experimentation, or related fields to join us in our research.  Please look at our advertisement <a href="https://mcgannlab.github.io/postdoc_ad.pdf">here</a>  </p>
 

            <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>

            <h3>07.2.2009</h3>
             <p>The move is done at last, and we are now ensconced in the Psychology Department at Rutgers.  Renovations to the new lab space are underway (sorry about the jackhammers, everyone)!</p>
 
            <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>

            <h3>02.18.2009</h3>
             <p>We're moving!  We're very pleased to announce that we will be moving to the Psychology Department at  <a href="http://psych.rutgers.edu">Rutgers University</a> late this summer. </p>

<p>             <div class="hr-yellow"> </div>

            <h3>11.12.2008</h3>
            <p>Look
for us at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting in Washington, DC
on Nov. 15 presenting data on how the sorptive properties of an odor
and nasal airflow interact to shape the representation of odors in the
brain.</p>
